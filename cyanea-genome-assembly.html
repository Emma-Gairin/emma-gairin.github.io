    <h2>Chrysiptera cyanea - Genome Assembly Pipeline</h2>

    <p>Chrysiptera cyanea is a common damselfish living in Indo-Pacific waters. To obtain its genome, its DNA was sequenced using PacBio HiFi, and the following pipeline was then used starting from the raw reads.
      The resulting genome and annotation are published at  https://doi.org/10.46471/gigabyte.144.

    <h3>1. Quality Control (QC) of Raw Reads</h3>
    <p>Before starting assembly, we perform quality control using tools like <strong>FastQC</strong> to evaluate the raw read quality.</p>

    <h3>2. Trimming</h3>
    <p>Low-quality bases and adapter sequences are removed using <strong>Trimmomatic</strong> to ensure clean input data for assembly.</p>

    <h3>3. Assembly</h3>
    <p>The genome assembly is performed using <strong>SPAdes</strong> or <strong>Canu</strong>, depending on the type of sequencing (short or long reads).</p>

    <h3>4. Post-Assembly QC</h3>
    <p>After assembly, we check for completeness and contamination using tools like <strong>BUSCO</strong> to assess genome assembly quality.</p>

    <h3>5. Annotation</h3>
    <p>Gene prediction and functional annotation are performed using tools like <strong>MAKER</strong> and <strong>Augustus</strong>.</p>
