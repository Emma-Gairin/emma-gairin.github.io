    <h2>Emma Gairin' Research Portfolio</h2>
      <ul class="pub-list">
      <li>I am a 4th-year PhD candidate working with the Marine Eco-Evo-Devo Unit at the Okinawa Institute of Science and Technology on the subtropical island of Okinawa, in Japan.</li>
      <li>My current research focuses on the links between environmental variables and gene expression levels in the blue damselfish <i>Chrysiptera cyanea</i>.
      As a first step for this research, I have assembled and annotated the <a href="https://doi.org/10.46471/gigabyte.144" target="_blank">genome</a> of this iconic Okinawan fish (find the pipeline <a href="https://emma-gairin.github.io/cyanea-genome-assembly.html" target="_blank">here</a>).
      I am now working on a large dataset to link environmental conditions with gene expression patterns in juvenile and adult fish, and have already presented my research at various Japanese and international <a href="https://emma-gairin.github.io/cv.html" target="_blank">conferences/a>. Stay tuned for the upcoming publications.
</li>
      <li>Prior to joining my current lab and becoming a fish and transcriptomics enthusiast, I obtained degrees in Earth Science and Ecology from the University of Edinburgh and Ecole Normale Superieure in Paris.
      During that time, I participated in multiple research projects in New Caledonia and French Polynesia, focusing on coral reef ecosystems, notably looking at marine protected areas but also at historical coastline changes and links between human activities and fish populations. Find a list of my research output <a href="https://emma-gairin.github.io/publications.html" target="_blank">here</a>.
      These research projects focused on habitat characterisation and fish ecology, and I found the patterns we observed in relation with human activities particularly interesting.</li>
       <li> This led me to seek to dig deeper into the mechanisms through which fish respond to their environment -- which I am now doing for my PhD using wild fish transcriptomes.</li>
