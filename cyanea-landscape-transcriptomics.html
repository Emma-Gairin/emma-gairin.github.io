    <h2>Transcriptomics Project Overview</h2>
    
    <p>Welcome to the transcriptomics project page! This project focuses on the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data to investigate gene expression patterns in various biological conditions. Our primary aim is to identify genes that are differentially expressed under various experimental conditions and gain insights into the molecular mechanisms that regulate these genes.</p>
    
    <p>In this project, we analyze the transcriptome of species under different treatments or environmental stresses, such as exposure to pollutants like PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate), to understand how these factors influence gene expression. This type of analysis is essential to reveal key pathways involved in stress responses, growth, and adaptation.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Objectives:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Identify genes that are differentially expressed in response to treatment.</li>
      <li>Explore the biological pathways affected by gene expression changes.</li>
      <li>Examine potential biomarkers for environmental stress.</li>
      <li>Use transcriptomic data to validate hypotheses on gene function.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Data Sources</h3>
    <p>The RNA-seq data used in this project was generated from various biological samples exposed to a variety of environmental conditions, including aquatic environments affected by contaminants. The data was processed using high-throughput sequencing platforms like Illumina, followed by rigorous quality control measures to ensure reliable results.</p>

    <h3>Methodology</h3>
    <p>The steps of the RNA-seq analysis pipeline are as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Use tools like <strong>FastQC</strong> to assess the quality of raw RNA-seq reads.</li>
      <li><strong>Trimming:</strong> Remove adapters and low-quality bases using <strong>Trimmomatic</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Map reads to a reference genome or transcriptome using <strong>STAR</strong> or <strong>Hisat2</strong>.</li>
      <li><strong>Differential Expression Analysis:</strong> Perform statistical analysis with tools like <strong>DESeq2</strong> or <strong>EdgeR</strong> to identify genes that show significant changes in expression across conditions.</li>
      <li><strong>Functional Annotation:</strong> Annotate differentially expressed genes with gene ontology (GO) terms and pathways using tools like <strong>DAVID</strong> or <strong>clusterProfiler</strong>.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Results & Applications</h3>
    <p>Preliminary results from the transcriptomics analysis have identified several key genes involved in environmental stress responses, some of which could serve as potential biomarkers for future monitoring efforts. Additionally, understanding these gene pathways will help inform strategies for mitigating the impacts of environmental pollutants on aquatic organisms.</p>
