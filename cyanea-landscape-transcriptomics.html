    <h2>Landscape transcriptomics</h2>
    
    <p>In Okinawa, the blue damselfish <i>Chrysiptera cyanea</i> can be found within a few meters of the shore in a large variety of locations, from urban river mouths to pristine fringing reefs. How do they acclimate to these highly variable environments? Which genes and biological pathways are involved in this fine-tuning?

    My PhD project focuses on the analysis of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) or transcriptomic data to explore how local conditions influence gene expression patterns, and in particular to identify marker genes for the exposure to human activity-related stress.       </p>
    <h3>Objectives:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Explore the response of genes to various environmental conditions in wild organisms.</li>
      <li>Test the complementarity between field and laboratory approaches using RNAseq.</li>
      <li>Identify potential biomarkers of environmental stress.</li>
    </ul>
